Project Report on Public Transport Usage Analysis in Switzerland
=============================================================

Project Description:
Project Goal: Analyze and forecast public transport usage in various regions of Switzerland.

Data and Processing:
We used data on public transport users in different regions and transport types.
The data was cleaned, transformed, and saved in the file 'public_transport_usage_cleaned.csv'.

Dependency Analysis:
We analyzed the dependency of public transport usage on weather conditions.

User Segmentation:
We performed user segmentation based on usage patterns.

Demand Prediction:
The Neural Network model showed the best performance with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1042.25.

Forecasting and Results:
Forecasting of the number of users for the future was done using the optimized Neural Network model.
The forecasting results were saved and visualized.

End of Report.
